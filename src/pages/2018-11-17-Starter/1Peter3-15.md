<!-- Needs something light or a joke or sth to get reader engaged -->
Some say that doing apologetics is like farting in an airplane - You're relieved and they're offended.

<!-- Too Long & straw man-ish -->
For a holy culture, apologetics is not merely about duty, though it is that, not about winning souls, though it is that. It is not merely about winning arguments, though it is about arguments. It is not merely about knowing the right facts.

Apologetics, believe it or not, is about suffering well.

Indisputably, the most popular proof for apologetics is 1 Peter 3:15.

> but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect, (ESV)

The emphasis is usually on

> *always being prepared to make a defense*

The Greek word here for defense is '*apologian*', from which we get the word 'apologetics'. This verse alone should encourage a Christian to intellectually engage the world with gospel hope, with an answer, reply, or defense.

But isn't there more? *Why* should we defend the faith? The scripture gives us reason, and we will follow the trail of breadcrumbs a bit.

## Christ as Holy

South Park is a great example for how Christ is made unholy by common culture - depicted in the most blasphemous ways (<!---Insert here--->) - His name is relentlessly drug through the mud when no real cannon fodder for comedy is available. At least Muhammad got censored!

A Christian's counter-counter reality starts with this verse in 1 Peter, and a way of living and moving that radically honors and reverences Christ is available to us!

The *reason* for a Christian's defense, and for their ready reply, is to set apart Christ as Holy.
